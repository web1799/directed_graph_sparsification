A directory with files related to compilation and scheduling on the
Beagle Cray XE6 at U Chicago CI/ANL.

* MATLAB wrapper functions that are compiled to MCC executables:
  linearSolvers.m
* mccCompile.m: MCC compilation script of a wrapper function
* MATLAB PBS job submission framework:
  matlab-batch
  matlab-job
* Shortcuts to submitting the main jobs:
  batch-downloadCollection
  batch-linearSolvers
* PBS test job scripts:
  test.pbs

Order of operations:
* Download my collection into the $data directory.
* Run ufget_all in MATLAB on sandbox: downloads entire UF collection into
  the directory $data/uf.
* Compile wrapper functions to mcc: mccCompile('linearSolvers'), etc.
* Run the script batch-downloadCollection on login to convert the entire
  collection under $data to our format and split multi-connected graphs
  into components.
* Run createIndex('lap') in MATLAB on sandbox to index our collection.
  Creates $data/lap_index.mat.
* Run batch-linearSolvers with an appropriate wall time and parameters
  to run LAMG on the test collection.
